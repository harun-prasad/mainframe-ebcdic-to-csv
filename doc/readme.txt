Project to convert mainframe EBCDIC, dBase and also ASCII files to CSV file.

Two main files are
1. ebcdic2csv.py - Script to convert mainframe EBCDIC file and also ASCII file to CSV file.
2. dbf2csv.py - Script to convert mainframe dBase file to CSV file.

Refer the above two files for runing instructions.

Note:
This project was initially written to convert the research datasets, to csv, available at
https://www.rrc.state.tx.us/about-us/resource-center/research/data-sets-available-for-download/
This mainly contains mainframe EBCDIC files, ASCII files, dbase files. Since this can be used for
any similar datasets, I have released this code for free use. 

Requirements
1. Install and run scripts on python 3.8 or above.
2. Install the python libraries as below
        pip install -r . \requirements.txt
